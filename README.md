## FAQ

A: Yes, it should be accessible at `https://krakowhackathon2022.g1-iad.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/{surveyId}`

Q: I see that there is an endpoint in shared APIs which is not present in postman, can I still use it?

A: Yes, We've only included a part of endpoints here, feel free to set them up by yourself and use them. You can submit an MR to this repo if you want to add a configuration :3
